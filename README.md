# gstats

Simple Rust tool to get quick summary info on git repos showing latest tag, branch, state. I implemented this to help me work with a the not too small
number of repositories as a result of Microservices.

The secondary reason is of course for me to try out Rust. So, please do critique or suggest improvement for the code.
